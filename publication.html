                Large neural models have demonstrated human-level performance on language and vision benchmarks such as ImageNet and Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI). Yet, their performance degrades considerably when tested on adversarial or out-of-distribution samples. This raises the question of whether these models have learned to solve a dataset rather than the underlying task by overfitting on spurious dataset biases. We investigate one recently proposed approach, AFLite, which adversarially filters such dataset biases, as a means to mitigate the prevalent overestimation of machine performance. We provide a theoretical understanding for AFLite, by situating it in the generalized framework for optimum bias reduction. Our experiments show that as a result of the substantial reduction of these biases, models trained on the filtered datasets yield better generalization to out-of-distribution tasks, especially when the benchmarks used for training are over-populated with biased samples. We show that AFLite is broadly applicable to a variety of both real and synthetic datasets for reduction of measurable dataset biases and provide extensive supporting analyses. Finally, filtering results in a large drop in model performance (e.g., from 92% to 63% for SNLI), while human performance still remains high. Our work thus shows that such filtered datasets can pose new research challenges for robust generalization by serving as upgraded benchmarks.

                Credible monitoring of remote workers presents unique challenges that may reduce the benefits
of formal organization for their management. We consider whether increasing the salience of
monitor productivity without changing incentive contracts or monitoring technology leads to
changes in remote worker performance. Results from a field experiment run among multidimensional task workers in Kenya demonstrate that increasing the visibility of monitor activity
improves performance on task dimensions not being directly paid for. Our evidence is consistent
with the importance of conspicuous monitoring when managers and workers are not co-located.

                Abductive reasoning is inference to the most plausible explanation. For example, if
                Jenny finds her house in a mess when she returns from work, and remembers that she
                left a window open, she can hypothesize that a thief broke into her house and caused
                the mess, as the most plausible explanation. While abduction has long been
                considered to be at the core of how people interpret and read between the lines in
                natural language (Hobbs et al. (1988)), there has been relatively little NLP
                research in support of abductive natural language inference. We present the first
                study that investigates the viability of language-based abductive reasoning. We
                conceptualize a new task of Abductive NLI and introduce a challenge dataset, ART,
                that consists of over 20k commonsense narrative contexts and 200k explanations,
                formulated as multiple choice questions for easy automatic evaluation. We establish
                comprehensive baseline performance on this task based on state-of-the-art NLI and
                language models, which leads to 68.9% accuracy, well below human performance
                (91.4%). Our analysis leads to new insights into the types of reasoning that deep
                pre-trained language models fail to perform -- despite their strong performance on
                the related but fundamentally different task of entailment NLI -- pointing to
                interesting avenues for future research.

                The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), proposed by Levesque et al. (2011) as an
                alternative to the Turing Test, was originally designed as a pronoun resolution
                problem that cannot be solved based on statistical patterns in large text corpora.
                However, recent studies suggest that current WSC datasets, even when composed
                carefully by experts, are still prone to such biases that statistical methods can
                exploit. We introduce WINOGRANDE, a new collection of WSC problems that are
                adversarially constructed to be robust against spurious statistical biases. While
                the original WSC dataset provided only 273 instances, WINOGRANDE includes 43,985
                instances, half of which are determined as adversarial. Key to our approach is a
                novel adversarial filtering algorithm AFLITE for systematic bias reduction, combined
                with a careful crowdsourcing design. Despite the significant increase in training
                data, the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods remains modest (61.6%)
                and contrasts with high human performance (90.8%) for the binary questions. In
                addition, WINOGRANDE allows us to use transfer learning for achieving new
                state-of-the-art results on the original WSC and related datasets. Finally, we
                discuss how biases lead to overestimating the true capabilities of machine
                commonsense.

                To apply eyeshadow without a brush, should I use a cotton swab or a toothpick?
                Questions requiring this kind of physical commonsense pose a challenge to today’s
                natural language understanding systems. While recent pretrained models (such as
                BERT) have made progress on question answering over more abstract domains – such as
                news articles and encyclopedia entries, where text is plentiful – in more physical
                domains, text is inherently limited due to reporting bias. Can AI systems learn to
                reliably answer physical commonsense questions without experiencing the physical
                world? In this paper, we introduce the task of physical commonsense reasoning and a
                corresponding benchmark dataset Physical Interaction: Question Answering or PIQA .
                Though humans find the dataset easy (95% accuracy), large pretrained models struggle
                (∼77%). We provide analysis about the dimensions of knowledge that existing models
                lack, which offers significant opportunities for future research.

                We introduce Social IQa, the first largescale benchmark for commonsense reasoning
                about social situations. Social IQa contains 38,000 multiple choice questions for
                probing emotional and social intelligence in a variety of everyday situations (e.g.,
                Q: "Jordan wanted to tell Tracy a secret, so Jordan leaned towards Tracy. Why did
                Jordan do this?" A: "Make sure no one else could hear"). Through crowdsourcing, we
                collect commonsense questions along with correct and incorrect answers about social
                interactions, using a new framework that mitigates stylistic artifacts in incorrect
                answers by asking workers to provide the right answer to a different but related
                question. Empirical results show that our benchmark is challenging for existing
                question-answering models based on pretrained language models, compared to human
                performance (>20% gap). Notably, we further establish Social IQa as a resource

                Understanding narratives requires reading between the lines, which in turn, requires
                interpreting the likely causes and effects of events, even when they are not
                mentioned explicitly. In this paper, we introduce Cosmos QA, a large-scale dataset
                of 35,600 problems that require commonsense-based reading comprehension, formulated
                as multiple-choice questions. In stark contrast to most existing reading
                comprehension datasets where the questions focus on factual and literal
                understanding of the context paragraph, our dataset focuses on reading between the
                lines over a diverse collection of people's everyday narratives, asking such
                questions as "what might be the possible reason of ...?", or "what would have
                happened if ..." that require reasoning beyond the exact text spans in the context.
                To establish baseline performances on Cosmos QA, we experiment with several
                state-of-the-art neural architectures for reading comprehension, and also propose a
                new architecture that improves over the competitive baselines. Experimental results
                demonstrate a significant gap between machine (68.4%) and human performance (94%),
                pointing to avenues for future research on commonsense machine comprehension.
                Dataset, code and leaderboard is publicly available at this
                .

                We report on the SemEval 2019 task on math question answering. We provided a
                question set derived from Math SAT practice exams, including 2778 training questions
                and 1082 test questions. For a significant subset of these questions, we also
                provided SMT-LIB logical form annotations and an interpreter that could solve these
                logical forms. Systems were evaluated based on the percentage of correctly answered
                questions. The top system correctly answered 45% of the test questions, a
                considerable improvement over the 17% random guessing baseline.

                We present ATOMIC, an atlas of everyday commonsense reasoning, organized through
                300k textual descriptions. Compared to existing resources that center around
                taxonomic knowledge, ATOMIC focuses on inferential knowledge organized as typed
                if-then relations with variables (e.g., "if X pays Y a compliment, then Y will
                likely return the compliment"). We propose nine if-then relation types to
                distinguish causes v.s. effects, agents v.s. themes, voluntary v.s. involuntary
                events, and actions v.s. mental states. By generatively training on the rich
                inferential knowledge described in ATOMIC, we show that neural models can acquire
                simple commonsense capabilities and reason about previously unseen events.
                Experimental results demonstrate that multitask models that incorporate the
                hierarchical structure of if-then relation types lead to more accurate inference
                compared to models trained in isolation, as measured by both automatic and human
                evaluation.

                We present an approach for answering questions that span multiple sentences and
                exhibit sophisticated cross-sentence anaphoric phenomena, evaluating on a rich
                source of such questions – the math portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT).
                By using a tree transducer cascade as its basic architecture, our system (called
                EUCLID) propagates uncertainty from multiple sources (e.g. coreference resolution or
                verb interpretation) until it can be confidently resolved. Experiments show the
                first-ever results (43% recall and 91% precision) on SAT algebra word problems. We
                also apply EUCLID to the public Dolphin algebra question set, and improve the
                state-of-the-art F1-score from 73.9% to 77.0%.

                High-throughput materials discovery involves the rapid synthesis, measurement, and
                characterization of many different but structurally related materials. A central
                problem in materials discovery, the phase map identification problem, involves the
                determination of the crystal structure of materials from materials composition and
                structural characterization data. We present Phase-Mapper, a novel solution platform
                that allows humans to interact with both the data and products of AI algorithms,
                including the incorporation of human feedback to constrain or initialize solutions.
                Phase-Mapper is compatible with any spectral demixing algorithm, including our novel
                solver, AgileFD, which is based on convolutive non-negative matrix factorization.
                AgileFD allows materials scientists to rapidly interpret XRD patterns, and can
                incorporate constraints to capture the physics of the materials as well as human
                feedback. We compare three solver variants with previously proposed methods in a
                large-scale experiment involving 20 synthetic systems, demonstrating the efficacy of
                imposing physical constraints using AgileFD. Since the deployment of Phase-Mapper at
                the Department of Energy’s Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP),
                thousands of X-ray diffraction patterns have been processed and the results are
                yielding discovery of new materials for energy applications, as exemplified by the
                discovery of a new family of metal oxide solar light absorbers, among the previously
                unsolved Nb-Mn-V oxide system, which is provided here as an illustrative example.
                Phase-Mapper is also being deployed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
                Lightsource (SSRL) to enable phase mapping on datasets in real time.

                Spatially Balanced Latin Squares are combinatorial struc- tures of great importance
                for experimental design. From a computational perspective they present a challenging
                problem and there is a need for efficient methods to generate them. Motivated by a
                real-world applica- tion, we consider a natural extension to this problem, balanced
                Latin Rectangles. Balanced Latin Rectangles appear to be even more defiant than
                balanced Latin Squares, to such an extent that perfect balance may not be feasible
                for Latin rectangles. Nonetheless, for real applications, it is still valuable to
                have well balanced Latin rectangles. In this work, we study some of the properties
                of balanced Latin rectangles, prove the nonexistence of perfect balance for an
                infinite family of sizes, and present several methods to generate the most balanced
                solutions.

                Rapid construction of phase diagrams is a central tenet of combinatorial materials
                science with accelerated materials discovery efforts often hampered by challenges in
                interpreting combinatorial X-ray diffraction data sets, which we address by
                developing AgileFD, an artificial intelligence algorithm that enables rapid phase
                mapping from a combinatorial library of X-ray diffraction patterns. AgileFD models
                alloying-based peak shifting through a novel expansion of convolutional nonnegative
                matrix factorization, which not only improves the identification of constituent
                phases but also maps their concentration and lattice parameter as a function of
                composition. By incorporating Gibbs’ phase rule into the algorithm, physically
                meaningful phase maps are obtained with unsupervised operation, and more refined
                solutions are attained by injecting expert knowledge of the system. The algorithm is
                demonstrated through investigation of the V–Mn–Nb oxide system where decomposition
                of eight oxide phases, including two with substantial alloying, provides the first
                phase map for this pseudoternary system. This phase map enables interpretation of
                high-throughput band gap data, leading to the discovery of new solar light absorbers
                and the alloying-based tuning of the direct-allowed band gap energy of MnV2O6. The
                open-source family of AgileFD algorithms can be implemented into a broad range of
                high throughput workflows to accelerate materials discovery.

                The ability to represent complex high dimensional probability distributions in a
                compact form is one of the key insights in the field of graphical models. Factored
                representations are ubiquitous in machine learning and lead to major computational
                advantages. We explore a different type of compact representation based on discrete
                Fourier representations, complementing the classical approach based on conditional
                independencies. We show that a large class of probabilistic graphical models have a
                compact Fourier representation. This theoretical result opens up an entirely new way
                of approximating a probability distribution. We demonstrate the significance of this
                approach by applying it to the variable elimination algorithm. Compared with the
                traditional bucket representation and other approximate inference algorithms, we
                obtain significant improvements.

                An increasing number of distributed data-driven applications are moving into shared
                public clouds. By sharing resources and operating at scale, public clouds promise
                higher utilization and lower costs than private clusters. To achieve high
                utilization, however, cloud providers inevitably instances of a given application
                may end-up in physically distant machines in the cloud. This allocation strategy can
                lead to large differences in average latency between instances. For a large class of
                applications, this difference can result in significant performance degradation,
                unless care is taken in how application components are mapped to instances. In this
                paper, we propose ClouDiA, a general deployment advisor that selects application
                node deployments minimizing either (i) the largest latency between application
                nodes, or (ii) the longest critical path among all application nodes. ClouDiA
                employs a number of algorithmic techniques, including mixed-integer programming and
                constraint programming techniques, to efficiently search the space of possible
                mappings of application nodes to instances. Through experiments with synthetic and
                real applications in Amazon EC2, we show that mean latency is a robust metric to
                model communication cost in these applications and that our search techniques yield
                a 15–55 % reduction in time-to-solution or service response time, without any need
                for modifying application code.

                Identifying important components or factors in large amounts of noisy data is a key
                problem in machine learning and data mining. Motivated by a pattern decomposition
                problem in materials discovery, aimed at discovering new materials for renewable
                energy, e.g. for fuel and solar cells, we introduce CombiFD, a framework for factor
                based pattern decomposition that allows the incorporation of a-priori knowledge as
                constraints, including complex combinatorial constraints. In addition , we propose a
                new pattern decomposition algorithm , called AMIQO, based on solving a sequence of
                (mixed-integer) quadratic programs. Our approach considerably outperforms the state
                of the art on the materials discovery problem, scaling to larger datasets and
                recovering more precise and physically meaningful de-compositions. We also show the
                effectiveness of our approach for enforcing background knowledge on other
                application domains.

                We propose a general framework for boosting combinatorial solvers through human
                computation. Our framework combines insights from human workers with the power of
                combinatorial optimization. The combinatorial solver is also used to guide requests
                for the workers , and thereby obtain the most useful human feedback quickly. Our
                approach also incorporates a problem decomposition approach with a general strategy
                for discarding incorrect human input. We apply this framework in the domain of
                materials discovery, and demonstrate a speedup of over an order of magnitude.

                According to the Erdős discrepancy conjecture, for any infinite ±1 sequence, there
                exists a homogeneous arithmetic progression of unbounded discrepancy. In other
                words, for any ±1 sequence (x1, x2, ...) and a discrepancy C, there exist integers m
                and d such that | m i=1 x i·d | > C. This is an 80-year-old open problem and
                recent development proved that this conjecture is true for discrepancies up to 2.
                Paul Erd˝ os also conjectured that this property of unbounded discrepancy even holds
                for the restricted case of completely multiplicative sequences (CMSs), namely
                sequences (x1, x2, ...) where x a·b = xa · x b for any a, b ≥ 1. The longest CMS
                with discrepancy 2 has been proven to be of size 246. In this paper, we prove that
                any completely multiplicative sequence of size 127, 646 or more has discrepancy at
                least 4, proving the Erd˝ os discrepancy conjecture for CMSs of discrepancies up to
                3. In addition, we prove that this bound is tight and increases the size of the
                longest known sequence of discrepancy 3 from 17, 000 to 127, 645. Finally, we
                provide inductive construction rules as well as streamlining methods to improve the
                lower bounds for sequences of higher discrepancies.

                Newly-discovered materials have been central to recent technological advances. They
                have contributed significantly to breakthroughs in electronics, renewable energy and
                green buildings, and overall, have promoted the advancement of global human welfare.
                Yet, only a fraction of all possible materials have been explored. Accelerating the
                pace of discovery of materials would foster technological innovations, and would
                potentially address pressing issues in sustainability, such as energy production or
                consumption. The bottleneck of this discovery cycle lies, however, in the analysis
                of the materials data. As materials scientists have recently devised techniques to
                efficiently create thousands of materials and experimentalists have developed new
                methods and tools to characterize these materials, the limiting factor has become
                the data analysis itself. Hence, the goal of this paper is to stimulate the
                development of new computational techniques for the analysis of materials data, by
                bringing together the complimentary expertise of materials scientists and computer
                scientists. In collaboration with two major research laboratories in materials
                science, we provide the first publicly available dataset for the phase map
                identification problem. In addition, we provide a parameterized synthetic data
                generator to assess the quality of proposed approaches, as well as tools for data
                visualization and solution evaluation.

                We will show how human computation insights can be key to identifying so-called
                backdoor variables in combinatorial optimization problems. Backdoor variables can be
                used to obtain dramatic speed-ups in combinatorial search. Our approach leverages
                the complementary strength of human input, based on a visual identification of
                problem structure , crowdsourcing, and the power of combina-torial solvers to
                exploit complex constraints. We describe our work in the context of the domain of
                materials discovery. The motivation for considering the materials discovery domain
                comes from the fact that new materials can provide solutions for key challenges in
                sustainability, e.g., in energy, new catalysts for more efficient fuel cell
                technology.

                We present the first polynomial time construction procedure for generating graceful
                double-wheel graphs. A graph is graceful if its vertices can be labeled with
                distinct integer values from {'{'}0, ..., e{'}'}, where e is the number of edges,
                such that each edge has a unique value corresponding to the absolute difference of
                its endpoints. Graceful graphs have a range of practical application domains,
                including in radio astronomy, X-ray crystallography, cryptography , and experimental
                design. Various families of graphs have been proven to be graceful, while others
                have only been conjectured to be. In particular, it has been conjectured that
                so-called double-wheel graphs are graceful. A double-wheel graph consists of two
                cycles of N nodes connected to a common hub. We prove this conjecture by providing
                the first construction for graceful double-wheel graphs, for any N > 3, using a
                framework that combines streamlined constraint reasoning with insights from human
                computation. We also use this framework to provide a polynomial time construction
                for diagonally ordered magic squares.

                An increasing number of distributed data-driven applications are moving into shared
                public clouds. By sharing resources and operating at scale, public clouds promise
                higher utilization and lower costs than private clusters. To achieve high
                utilization, however, cloud providers inevitably allocate virtual machine instances
                non-contiguously; i.e., instances of a given application may end-up in physically
                distant machines in the cloud. This allocation strategy can lead to large
                differences in average latency between instances. For a large class of applications,
                this difference can result in significant performance degradation, unless care is
                taken in how application components are mapped to instances. In this paper, we
                propose ClouDiA, a general deployment advisor that selects application node
                deployments minimizing either (i) the largest latency between application nodes, or
                (ii) the longest critical path among all application nodes. ClouDiA employs a number
                of algorithmic techniques, including mixed-integer programming and constraint
                programming techniques, to efficiently search the space of possible mappings of
                application nodes to instances. Through experiments with synthetic and real
                applications in Amazon EC2, we show that mean latency is a robust metric to model
                communication cost in these applications and that our search techniques yield a
                15–55 % reduction in time-to-solution or service response time, without any need for
                modifying application code.

                Our work is motivated by an important network design application in computational
                sustainability concerning wildlife conservation. In the face of human development
                and climate change, it is important that conservation plans for protecting landscape
                connectivity exhibit certain level of robustness. While previous work has focused on
                conservation strategies that result in a connected network of habitat reserves, the
                ro-bustness of the proposed solutions has not been taken into account. In order to
                address this important aspect, we formalize the problem as a node-weighted
                bi-criteria network design problem with connectivity requirements on the number of
                disjoint paths between pairs of nodes. While in most previous work on survivable
                network design the objective is to minimize the cost of the selected network, our
                goal is to optimize the quality of the selected paths within a specified budget ,
                while meeting the connectivity requirements. We characterize the complexity of the
                problem under different restrictions. We provide a mixed-integer programming
                encoding that allows for finding solutions with optimality guarantees, as well as a
                hybrid local search method with better scaling behavior but no guarantees. We
                evaluate the typical-case performance of our approaches using a synthetic benchmark,
                and apply them to a large-scale real-world network design problem concerning the
                conservation of wolverine and lynx populations in the U.S. Rocky Mountains
                (Montana).

                Biodiversity underpins ecosystem goods and services and hence protecting it is key
                to achieving sustainability. However, the persistence of many species is threatened
                by habitat loss and fragmentation due to human land use and climate change.
                Conservation efforts are implemented under very limited economic resources, and
                therefore designing scalable, cost-efficient and systematic approaches for
                conservation planning is an important and challenging computational task. In
                particular, preserving landscape connectivity between good habitat has become a key
                conservation priority in recent years. We give an overview of landscape connectivity
                conservation and some of the underlying graph-theoretic optimization problems. We
                present a synthetic generator capable of creating families of randomized structured
                problems, capturing the essential features of real-world instances but allowing for
                a thorough typical-case performance evaluation of different solution methods. We
                also present two large-scale real-world datasets, including economic data on land
                cost, and species data for grizzly bears, wolverines and lynx.

                Practical problems often combine real-world hard constraints with soft constraints
                involving preferences, uncertainties or flexible requirements. A probability
                distribution over the models that meet the hard constraints is an answer to such
                problems that is in the spirit of incorporating soft constraints. We propose a
                method using SAT-based reasoning, probabilistic reasoning and linear programming
                that computes such a distribution when soft constraints are interpreted as
                constraints whose violation is bound by a given probability. The method, called
                Optimized Probabilistic Satis-fiability (oPSAT), consists of a two-phase computation
                of a probability distribution over the set of valuations of a SAT formula.
                Algorithms for both phases are presented and their complexity is discussed. We also
                describe an application of the oPSAT technique to the problem of combinatorial
                materials discovery.

                In recent years, significant progress in the area of search, constraint
                satisfaction, and automated reasoning has been driven in part by the study of
                challenge problems from combinatorics and finite algebra. This work has led to the
                discovery of interesting discrete structures with intricate mathematical properties.
                While some of those results have resolved open questions and conjectures, a
                shortcoming is that they generally do not provide further mathematical insights,
                from which one could derive more general observations. We propose an approach that
                integrates specialized combina-torial search, using so-called streamlining, with a
                human computation component. We use this approach to discover efficient constructive
                procedures for generating certain classes of combinatorial objects of any size. More
                specifically, using our framework, we discovered two complementary efficient
                constructions for generating so-called Spatially Balanced Latin squares (SBLS) of
                any order N, such that 2N+1 is prime. Previously constructions for SBLSs were not
                known. Our approach also enabled us to derive a new lower bound for so-called weak
                Schur numbers, improving on a series of earlier results for Schur numbers.

                Combinatorial materials science involves the rapid, high-throughput synthesis,
                measurement, and analysis of a large number of different but structurally related
                materials. In combinatorial materials discovery, materials scientists search for
                intermetallic compounds with desirable physical properties by obtaining measurements
                on hundreds of samples from a composition spread. Determining the structure of the
                materials formed in a composition spread is key to understanding composition and
                property relations and can potentially result in a breakthrough materials discovery.
                This is an important and exciting direction in the emerging field of computational
                sustainability [4] as it aims to achieve the best possible use of our available
                material resources. One ultimate objective is to help discover the next-generation
                materials for fuel-cell catalysis, as such materials have the potential of
                dramatically increasing fuel cell capacity while reducing their cost. The analysis
                of composition spreads remains, however, a manual and laborious task. Thus the need
                for new techniques to automatically analyze and interpret such data. Whereas the
                data-intensive aspect of the area of materials discovery seems to favor Data-Mining
                or Machine Learning techniques, the rigorous and highly-structured physical
                properties that govern the crystallization on the composition spread interestingly
                suggest that constraint reasoning is key to a physically meaningful analysis. In
                this paper, we describe two novel approaches to this problem that integrate
                domain-specific scientific background knowledge about the physical and chemical
                properties of the materials. Our first approach combines constraint programming (CP)
                and machine learning (ML), while the second is based on satisfiability modulo theory
                (SMT). We evaluate the performance of our methods on realistic synthetic
                measurements, and we show that it provides accurate and physically meaningful
                interpretations of the data, even in the presence of artificially added noise.

                In combinatorial materials discovery, one searches for new materials with desirable
                properties by obtaining measurements on hundreds of samples in a single
                high-throughput batch experiment. As manual data analysis is becoming more and more
                impractical, there is a growing need to develop new techniques to automatically
                analyze and interpret such data. We describe a novel approach to the phase map
                identification problem where we integrate domain-specific scientific background
                knowledge about the physical and chemical properties of the materials into an SMT
                reasoning framework. We evaluate the performance of our method on realistic
                synthetic measurements, and we show that it provides accurate and physically
                meaningful interpretations of the data, even in the presence of artificially added
                noise.

                Motivated by an important and challenging task encountered in material discovery, we
                consider the problem of finding K basis patterns of numbers that jointly compose N
                observed patterns while enforcing additional spatial and scaling constraints. We
                propose a Constraint Programming (CP) model which captures the exact problem
                structure yet fails to scale in the presence of noisy data about the patterns. We
                alleviate this issue by employing Machine Learning (ML) techniques, namely kernel
                methods and clustering, to decompose the problem into smaller ones based on a global
                data-driven view, and then stitch the partial solutions together using a global CP
                model. Combining the complementary strengths of CP and ML techniques yields a more
                accurate and scalable method than the few found in the literature for this complex
                problem.

                Accurately estimating the distribution of solutions to a problem , should such
                solutions exist, provides efficient search heuristics. The purpose of this paper is
                to propose new ways of computing such estimates , with different degrees of accuracy
                and complexity. We build on the Expectation-Maximization Belief-Propagation (EMPB)
                framework proposed by Hsu et al. to solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs).
                We propose two general approaches within the EMBP framework: we firstly derive
                update rules at the constraint level while enforcing domain consistency and then
                derive update rules globally, at the problem level. The contribution of this paper
                is twofold: first, we derive new generic update rules suited to tackle any CSP;
                second, we propose an efficient EMBP-inspired approach, thereby improving this
                method and making it competitive with the state of the art. We evaluate these
                approaches experimentally and demonstrate their effectiveness.

                                                        <p>Generalization to harder compositional problem instances (a.k.a extrapolation) is challenging for standard neural networks. In contrast, recursive neural networks have the potential to achieve extrapolation because they are able to capture the compositionality of tree-structured data such as mathematical equations. However, recursive networks are prone to error propagation along trees of high depth and are unable to capture long range dependencies effectively. To overcome this, we propose Tree Stack Memory Units (Tree-SMUs), a novel memory augmented recursive neural network whose nodes consist of a differentiable stack. Each SMU cell learns to read from its stack and to write to it by combining the stacks and states of its children through gating. This architecture improves both the local and global representation of compositional data due to better expressive power and the ability to capture long-range dependencies by giving each node indirect access to its descendants. We demonstrate strong empirical results on two tasks and show that Tree-SMU enables accurate extrapolation to significantly harder instances.</p>

However, they can only operate within a limited "supported" domain of discourse and fail drastically when faced with an out-of-domain utterance, mainly due to the limitations of their semantic parser. In this paper, we propose a semantic parser that generalizes to out-of-domain examples by learning a general strategy for parsing an unseen utterance through adapting the logical forms of seen utterances, instead of learning to generate a logical form from scratch. Our parser maintains a memory consisting of a representative subset of the seen utterances paired with their logical forms. Given an unseen utterance, our parser works by looking up a similar utterance from the memory and adapting its logical form until it fits the unseen utterance. Moreover, we present a data generation strategy for constructing utterance-logical form pairs from different domains.

                                                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                                                        <p>We propose using symbolic
                                                        data for training neural networks that solve differential equations.This results in a generalizable and scalable neural
                                                        solver. The main reason is that we jointly learn a large number
                                                        of functions, that cover an entire mathematical domain,
                                                        and use these trained functions for solving an unseen differential equation. Almost all of the literature focuses on
                                                        hand-crafting architectures that are tailored for a specific
                                                        type of differential equation. Moreover, they use numerical
                                                        evaluations of a differential equation for training, which
                                                        means that training and tuning needs to be redone for solving
                                                        a different input differential equation resulting in a lack
                                                        of scalability and generalizability.</p>
                                                        <p>In this work, we investigate the possibility of using neural
                                                        programs for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
                                                        by verifying/rejecting a candidate solution of an ODE. We
                                                        design a neural programmer that is capable of choosing the
                                                        correct solution with a high accuracy. Our neural programmer,
                                                        based on a Tree-LSTM, leverages the
                                                        compositionality of each input ODE.</p>

                                                        <p>Neural programming involves training neural networks to learn programs, mathematics, or logic from data. Previous works have failed to achieve good generalization performance, especially on problems and programs with high complexity or on large domains. This is because they mostly rely either on black-box function evaluations that do not capture the structure of the program, or on detailed execution traces that are expensive to obtain, and hence the training data has poor coverage of the domain under consideration. We present a novel framework that utilizes black-box function evaluations, in conjunction with symbolic expressions that define relationships between the given functions. We employ tree LSTMs to incorporate the structure of the symbolic expression trees. We use tree encoding for numbers present in function evaluation data, based on their decimal representation. We present an evaluation benchmark for this task to demonstrate our proposed model combines symbolic reasoning and function evaluation in a fruitful manner, obtaining high accuracies in our experiments. Our framework generalizes significantly better to expressions of higher depth and is able to fill partial equations with valid completions.</p>

                                                        <p>In this paper we propose guaranteed spectral methods for learning a broad range of topic models, which generalize the popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We overcome the limitation of LDA to incorporate arbitrary topic correlations, by assuming that the hidden topic proportions are drawn from a flexible class of Normalized Infinitely Divisible (NID) distributions. NID distributions are generated by normalizing a family of independent Infinitely Divisible (ID) random variables. The Dirichlet distribution is a special case obtained by normalizing a set of Gamma random variables. We prove that this flexible topic model class can be learnt via spectral methods using only moments up to the third order, with (low order) polynomial sample and computational complexity. The proof is based on a key new technique derived here that allows us to diagonalize the moments of the NID distribution through an efficient procedure that requires evaluating only univariate integrals, despite the fact that we are handling high dimensional multivariate moments. In order to assess the performance of our proposed Latent NID topic model, we use two real datasets of articles collected from New York Times and Pubmed. Our experiments yield improved perplexity on both datasets compared with the baseline.</p>

                                                        <p>Scalable probabilistic modeling and prediction in high dimensional multivariate time-series is a challenging problem, particularly for systems with hidden sources of dependence and/or homogeneity. Examples of such problems include dynamic social networks with co-evolving nodes and edges and dynamic student learning in online courses. Here, we address these problems through the discovery of hierarchical latent groups. We introduce a family of Conditional Latent Tree Models (CLTM), in which tree-structured latent variables incorporate the unknown groups. The latent tree itself is conditioned on observed covariates such as seasonality, historical activity, and node attributes. We propose a statistically efficient framework for learning both the hierarchical tree structure and the parameters of the CLTM. We demonstrate competitive performance in multiple real world datasets from different domains. These include a dataset on students' attempts at answering questions in a psychology MOOC, Twitter users participating in an emergency management discussion and interacting with one another, and windsurfers interacting on a beach in Southern California. In addition, our modeling framework provides valuable and interpretable information about the hidden group structures and their effect on the evolution of the time series.</p>

This design enables the bea ormer to compensate for non-integer delays and frequency dependent dispersion and at the same time increases the accuracy of the beamformer. It is shown that the proposed imaging algorithm reduces the computational cost and memory of the imaging system by decreasing the sampling rate to the Nyquist rate and significantly reducing the number of required matrix inversions. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm significantly improves the quali  of the obtained image and on average the signal-to-clutter ratio of the image is increased by 89.29% compared to other cases.</p>
