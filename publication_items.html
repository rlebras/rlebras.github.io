                Accurately estimating the distribution of solutions to a problem , should such
                solutions exist, provides efficient search heuristics. The purpose of this paper is
                to propose new ways of computing such estimates , with different degrees of accuracy
                and complexity. We build on the Expectation-Maximization Belief-Propagation (EMPB)
                framework proposed by Hsu et al. to solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs).
                We propose two general approaches within the EMBP framework: we firstly derive
                update rules at the constraint level while enforcing domain consistency and then
                derive update rules globally, at the problem level. The contribution of this paper
                is twofold: first, we derive new generic update rules suited to tackle any CSP;
                second, we propose an efficient EMBP-inspired approach, thereby improving this
                method and making it competitive with the state of the art. We evaluate these
                approaches experimentally and demonstrate their effectiveness.
